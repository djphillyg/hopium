<goal>
- think of an outline of a product that i could vibecode in 48 hours at Vibecon
</goal>

<context>
- i won an entry to Vibecon, hosted by YC and the top 3 teams get an automatic YC interview
- this event is sponsored by amazon, emergent labs, and also anthropic itself (you lol)
- you are to use emergent.sh which allows you to vibecode apps
- its 48 hours, so it needs to be something that can be feasibly done for an MVP
- i also want to network, so maybe it having a core feature or two, and not be fully complete, but really good at 1 thing
- or even maybe just really good for a demo
</context>


<submission>
- i submitted for an idea for some sort of hopium agent
- my thought process was that, i lost my sparkle for a littel bit and i have it back
- i want to build an application that helpes me reframe my thoughts in a more positive tone back to me
- an application that takes in different data points about me like intention journaling, and therapeutic goals and reflects them back
- maybe some sort of timer so i know how much time i give everyday, like duolingo for working on your self-worth
- (maybe a voice agent that is offered through vapi and has a prompt that handles reframing and takes notes on you)
</submission>

steps:
1. go through the specific guidelines.
2. help me think of high level stories that my potential hopium agent (hopium is a play on opium -> but for hope), and how it would play with the YC money or nothing crowd. i want to find a mix of authenticity and it comes out in the feautures
3. help me think of potential MVPs of this application that i could build out
4. help me be realistic too. i want to engage with the workshops and what not, and be able to come out with something that is imaginative and simple.
